                        ### Global Perspective
                       
                        Rift between West and the Rest continues with possible future consequences on financial and economic stability:
                    
                        - The IMFC was not able to reach a common [communique](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/04/14/pr23120-chairs-statement-forty-seventh-meeting-of-the-imfc) in April 2023 reflecting the impact that security issues have on the global economy. 
                        
                        - US effort to diversify supply chains away from China to other asian countries faces [challenges](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/us-led-effort-diversify-indo-pacific-supply-chains-away-china-runs-counter). 
                       
                        - War in Ukraine is stalling.

                        ### The Inflation shock

                        Inflation is returning slowly to target: 
                        - US [faster](assets/fig188.html)
                        - EA [slower](assets/fig1888.html)
                        - however new supply shocks are possible: SA and Russia recent decision to curb production.

                        ### Portugal Outlook

                    
                        - Tourism had fully recovered from the Pandemic but inflation appears to have reduced demand. [growth](assets/fig1.html),[unemployment](assets/fig2.html),[tourism](assets/fig7.html)
                        - External position is slowly but continously improving strenghtening finacial resilience [NIIP](assets/fig18.html)
                        - Political stability has **decreased**  and wage pressures have increased but so far budget appears to be balanced [debt to gdp](assets/fig3.html), [primary surplus](assets/fig4.html), [yields](assets/fig5.html)

                        ### Real estate market

                        - Increase in interest rates have depressed demand and decrease sales. 90% of mortgages are with variables interest rates. [interest rates](assets/fig10.html)  
                        - So far permits (epected construction) is not declining [permits](assets/fig8.html)
                        - ...and prices are keeping their strong positive dynamics [prices](assets/fig9.html) still defying gravity.

                        ### NPL Market
                        
                        Last 8 years the NPL ratio has come substantially down [NPL ratio](assets/fig11.html)

                        | Sector     |   2023Q1   |   2022Q1   |Ratio 2023Q1|

                        ### Loans in Portugal

                        - The NPL ratio had decreased both though the numerator and denominator as loans to Households had increased, but now loans have stagnated [Loans HH](assets/fig12.html)
                        - With Corporates the banks have been more cautious and lended only through the 8-10 billion euro guaranteed by the State during Covid. Now decreasing [Loans NFC](assets/fig13.html)

                        ### Lending opportunity in Portugal

                        We think there are two driving forces behind our granular lending strategy:
                        1. New Loans under 1M have decreased structurally after the Covid period. The gap between the monthly average 2018-2021 and the monthly average 2021-todaz is 5000 M. We target 1% of this gap.
                        2. The new loans have not so far been discouraged by the increase in the interest rate (as opposed to all loans) [graph](assets/fig14.html)

                         ### Lending opportunity in Portugal

                         We also believe that the combination of the increase in the interest rate and inflation has created liquidity management problems to SME:
                         1. VAT went from 8.8% of GDP in 2019 to 9.4% in 2022 (and 2023 will be likely higher)
                         2. Firms pay VAT on a monthly or quaterly basis. They receive the info of the amount a few days before the deadline (penalties for late payments are massive)

                         <!-- .slide: style="text-align: left;" -->

                        ### Conclusions

                        - Inflation is coming down slowly and if new supply shocks do not materialize should reach its target in 2025 
                        - We think NPL are likely to increase especially secured residential and unsecured consumer but only in 18/36 months.
                        - Residential prices should stop increasing.
                        - **Loan demand by corporates both for Term loans and liquidity needs should be sustained but underserviced by banks.**
                        - Portugal presents sufficiently robust fundamentals.
