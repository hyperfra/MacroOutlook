                        ### Global Perspective
                        Our Scenario I where Geo-politics trumps Geo-economics is unfortunately materializing

                        - Politics: Canada (following the [US](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0714)) argues that countries should condition economic relations on political values overturning the notion of uniform treatment across trade partners.
                        - Laws: Inflation Reduction Act ([EU is not happy](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/why-us-allies-are-upset-over-electric-vehicle-subsidies-inflation) and will respond adopting similar measures) and [semiconductors](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/national-security-semiconductors-and-us-move-cut-china).

                        ### The Inflation shock

                        Is inflation caused by  a supply or a demand shock? We still believe our last October narrative is correct:
                        - Supply: the post-pandemic global economy was hit by an energy and commodity shock negative supply shock.
                        - Demand: in some sectors the increase un consumption relative to the pandemic period has fueled inflation (Tourism/goods)
                        [example: inflation in Portugal](assets/fig17.html)

                        ### Difficult job for Monetary Policy

                        - Fed surprised by persistent inflation will continue to increase rates until... the data will tell them to calm down [US Inflation surprise](assets/fig188.html).
                        - In EA job for Monetary Policy is even more complex as inflation is much less demand driven [EA](assets/fig44.html) but will continue to increase until they will fall behind the curve.
                        - Long term fundamentals (demography, aging, lower productivity trend) are still pointing to a low natural interest rate environment after the current inflationary cycle.

                        ### Portugal Outlook

                    
                        - Tourism has fully recovered from the Pandemic and reached new records [growth](assets/fig1.html),[unemployment](assets/fig2.html),[tourism](assets/fig7.html)
                        - External position is slowly but continously improving strenghtening finacial resilience [NIIP](assets/fig18.html)
                        - Political stability has **decreased** although still able to contain wage pressures and control on spending [debt to gdp](assets/fig3.html), [primary surplus](assets/fig4.html), [yields](assets/fig5.html)

                        ### Real estate market

                        - increase in interest rates has not yet depressed demand and increase sales. 90% of mortgages are with variables interest rates.  [interest rates](assets/fig10.html)
                        - so far permits (epected construction) is not declining [permits](assets/fig8.html)
                        - and prices are keeping their strong positive dynamics [prices](assets/fig9.html) defying gravity.

                        ### Loans in Portugal

                        - The NPL ratio decreased both though the numerator and denominator as loans to Households have increased [Loans HH](assets/fig12.html)
                        - with Corporates the banks have been more cautious and lended only through the 6 billion euro guaranteed by the State [Loans NFC](assets/fig13.html)
                        - Loans to corporates under 1M  [Loans NFC UM1](assets/fig14.html) are underserviced. (blip due to pandemic loans)

                        ### Conclusions

                        - Monetary policy future stance will play an important role in determining economic performance. In words they are likely to tighten by another 100 bps (euro). The markets do not appear to agree.
                        - We still think NPL are likely to increase especially secured residential and unsecured consumer in 12-18 months.
                        - Residential prices should decresase or at least stop increasing.
                        - Loan demand by corporates should be sustained.
                        - Portugal presents sufficiently robust fundamentals.
